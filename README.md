# Features

Compared to compile-hero:

- SASS was not compiled at all
- Most files types were compiling fine, but crashed the extension-host on vscode if they contained an error, or did just do nothing or create empty files
- Added an editor notification to show compile errors 
- compile status (failed/successful) is now correctly shown in the statusbar
- Added test files
- Added a missing dependency
- Removed a function that could be used to connect to a chinese server to register the IP and other data
- Removed necessary files
- Added test files


Easily work with `less, sass, scss, typescript, jade, pug and jsx` files in Visual Studio Code.

Compile on save `(ctrl+s)` for `less, sass, scss, typescript, jade, pug and jsx` files without using a build task.

- Compile `less, sass, scss, typescript, jade, pug and jsx` on save.
- Support autoprefixer for `less, scss, scss`.
- Support to open `html` files to preview in browser.
- minify `.js` and `.css` files.

|Before Compile|After Compile|
|-|-|
|.pug|.html|
|.jade|.html|
|.scss/.sass|.css|
|.less|.css|
|.ts/.tsx|.js(JSX)|
|.js(ES6)|.js(ES5)|

Easy to use. When you writing a file, press save `ctrl+s` to generate the compiled file in the same directory. I hope you can get rid of the constraint of `gulp` or `webpack`üòÅ or external helper tools.

# Configuration

Click to open the extension management interface `Configure Extension Settings`, You can change the path of the project compilation directory, or toggle the switch of language.

Right click the `html` file in the directory menu, and the `open in browser` option will appear. You can preview the page in the chrome browser only.

# Close Port

At some point, you may be using ports for some services. You can use the `close port` command to close. (OSX/Linux, not Windows)
