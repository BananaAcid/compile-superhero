# Features

Compared to compile-hero:

- Added a command to generate all superhero settings into a local project folder
- Fixed SASS was not compiled at all
- Fixed most files types were compiling fine, but crashed the extension-host on vscode if they contained an error, or did just do nothing or create empty files
- Added an editor notification to show compile errors 
- Fixed Compile status (failed/successful) is now correctly shown in the statusbar
- Added test files
- Added a missing dependency
- Removed a function that could be used to connect to a chinese server to register the IP and other data
- Removed necessary files
- Added test files
- Added an option to enable compiling files in mixin (`mixin` and `mixins`) folders, **this is off by default**!

# Compile-Superhero

Easily work with `less, sass, scss, typescript, jade, pug and jsx` files in Visual Studio Code.

Compile on save `(ctrl+s)` - or select `Compile File(s)` at the right-click menu for `less, sass, scss, typescript, jade, pug and jsx` files without using a build task.

- Compile `less, sass, scss, typescript, jade, pug and jsx` on save
- Support autoprefixer for `less, scss, scss`
- Support to open `html` files to preview in chrome browser
- minify `.js`, `.css` and `.html` files

|Before Compile|After Compile|
|-|-|
|.pug|.html|
|.jade|.html|
|.scss/.sass|.css|
|.less|.css|
|.ts/.tsx|.js(JSX)|
|.js(ES6)|.js(ES5)|

Easy to use. When you writing a file, press save (<kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd>) to generate the compiled file in the same directory (or different if changed in the settings). No need for `gulp` or `webpack` or external helper tools.

# Configuration

Click to open the extension management interface (`Configure Extension Settings`), You can change the path of the project compilation directory, or enable/disable the compilation of any supported file format.

- Project-wide settings are configured using the standard `settings.json` file (i.e. Workspace Settings).

# Generate compile-superhero local default config

You might want to locally modify the settings of this extension for easy modification/distribution with the project.

You can use the `Generate compile-superhero local default config` command to generate it:
it will create a `.vscode/settings.json` or add missing entries, to your project folder.

# Open In Browser

Right click the `html` file in the directory menu, and the `open in browser` option will appear. You can preview the page using a fullfile path (security restrictions - not all might work) in the chrome browser only.

- But it would be better to use the [LiveServer by Ritwick Dey](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

# Close Port

At some point, you may be using ports for some services. If they are blocked, you can use the `close port` command to close them. (OSX/Linux, not Windows)
